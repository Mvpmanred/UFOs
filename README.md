## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to help Dana to build a table using data stored in a JavaScript array and to make hte table fully dynamic. It will react to user input and then place the table into a HTML file for users to view easily.Also i will customize the webage using Bootstrap, and equip the table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with our visualizations. The data analysis would be on Dana's collection of UFO data.
